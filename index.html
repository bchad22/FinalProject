  <h3>The Infamous Syracuse, N.Y.</h3> </div>
  <p>The city of Syracuse does not hold the reputation of being a comfortable and safe place to build a family, live with friends, or on your own. The city has a score of just “5” on the Total Crime Index, meaning it is safer than just 5% of United States cities. And like the saying goes, it takes 20 years to build a good reputation and just five minutes to ruin it. 
<br>
<br>
  So although its reputation for being an unsafe and dangerous city may not go away anytime soon, has Syracuse gotten at all safer in the past half decade? Well the amount of arrests the Syracuse Police Department made from 2020-2023 was consistently over 12,000 each year, but as you can see below, 2024 looks to be breaking that trend.</p>

<h3>What Changed?</h3> 
</div>
<p>“Crime has decreased here in Syracuse” said Syracuse Police Department’s Public Information Specialist Kieran Coffey. “Property crimes and stolen vehicle incidents have stayed consistent but the violent crime number is down about 9%"." 
<br>
<br>
Coincidentally, the Syracuse Police Department didn’t specifically make violent crimes a point of emphasis going into the year as opposed to other types of crime. However, Coffey said it’s a different story when it comes to getting illegal guns off the street.
<br> 
<br>
“It was a target area going into this year. We’re trying to get as many ghost and illegal guns off the street as we can. We have specific details going out to make these gun arrests which we hope will in turn lessen to overall amount of ownership here in Syracuse".</p>
